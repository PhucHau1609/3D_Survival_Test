  - "Hey, it\u2019s you again! Thank you so much for helping me last time. My father
    was really impressed with the rabbit hides you brought back."
  - "But\u2026 there\u2019s something else I need help with. It\u2019s about an old
    map my father mentioned. He said it shows secret paths and hidden places on the
    island."
  - "I\u2019ve tried looking for it myself, but it\u2019s rumored to be hidden in
    the old ruins near the lake to the north. And, well\u2026 I\u2019m not exactly
    good with exploring dangerous places."
  - "Would you be willing to help me again? If you can find the map piece, I\u2019ll
    make sure you\u2019re rewarded properly. What do you say?"
