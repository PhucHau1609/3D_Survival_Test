    me with the map last time. I\u2019ve been going through it, and I found something
    strange."
  - "There\u2019s a note in the margin of the map, something my father wrote. It
    mentions an old book\u2014supposedly a journal\u2014that holds the secrets of
    the island. It's supposed to be hidden in the library ruins on the west side."
  - "I can\u2019t go there on my own. The place is crawling with wild creatures,
    and I'm not equipped for a fight. But\u2026 maybe you can help me again?"
  - "If you could find this book and bring it back, I\u2019ll be forever grateful.
    I don\u2019t know what this journal holds, but it could be very important."
  - Please, would you help me?
